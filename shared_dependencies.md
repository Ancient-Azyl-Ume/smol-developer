Shared Dependencies:

1. **Data Schema**: The data schema for the scraped Reddit data will be shared between the `reddit_scraper.py`, `scrapy_settings.py`, `pocketbase_handler.py` files and the `pocketbase.ts` file in the Next.js app. This schema will define the structure of the data being scraped and stored in the PocketBase backend.

2. **PocketBase API**: The PocketBase API will be a shared dependency between the `pocketbase_handler.py` file in the web scraper and the `pocketbase.ts` file in the Next.js app. This API will be used to store the scraped data and retrieve it for the Next.js app.

3. **Product Data**: The product data (extracted from Reddit) will be shared between the `index.tsx`, `product/[id].tsx`, `ProductCard.tsx`, and `ProductPage.tsx` files in the Next.js app. This data will be used to render the product listings and individual product pages.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The IDs of DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use are shared between the `index.tsx`, `product/[id].tsx`, `ProductCard.tsx`, and `ProductPage.tsx` files. These IDs will be used to manipulate the DOM elements in these files.

5. **CSS Styles**: The CSS styles defined in `index.css` and `product.css` will be shared across the `index.tsx`, `product/[id].tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `ProductCard.tsx`, and `ProductPage.tsx` files. These styles will be used to style the components in these files.

6. **Component Functions**: The functions defined in the `ProductCard.tsx` and `ProductPage.tsx` components will be shared with the `index.tsx` and `product/[id].tsx` files. These functions will be used to handle user interactions with the product listings and individual product pages.

7. **Message Names**: Any message names used for communication between the web scraper and the Next.js app will be shared between the `reddit_scraper.py`, `scrapy_settings.py`, `pocketbase_handler.py` files and the `pocketbase.ts` file in the Next.js app. These message names will be used to trigger specific actions or events.
